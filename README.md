# Deeplearning Homework 3 by Sándor Dániel

The task was to predict the mean temperatures with neural network. My datat can be found at:http://wieser.hu/wxtempdetail.php?year=2016.I accomplished the task with a network with 2 hidden layers with 10 and 20 neurons, with early stopping with a patience of 50, using keras. The predictions for the given dates can be found at the end of the notebook.
